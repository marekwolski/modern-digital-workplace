# modern-digital-workplace

This github repo is home to Marek's guide to the modern digital workplace.

It addresses the scope and purpose of the modern digital workplace, the three "Experiences" through which we can decide what good looks like and describes the seven core "jigsaw pieces" that any worthwhile modern digital workplace is made from.

Start here [Introduction](docs/0 Introduction.md) for the beginning or jump to the [Contents](https://github.com/marekwolski/modern-digital-workplace/docs/1%20Contents.md).

I decided to write this guide after failing to find anything like it that wasn't compromised by the need of a vendor to sell their stuff or skewed by someone dazzled by the latest wizzy thing. I have worked for a systems integrator for a very, very long time and it's my job to collect **all** the pieces of a solution that are required and knit them together into something **that works** for all the stakeholders.

If you have any comments or questions I'd love to hear from you, so please do get in contact. If you have something you'd like to contribute then, again, please do contact me and let's see if we can put the power of GitHub to good use!
