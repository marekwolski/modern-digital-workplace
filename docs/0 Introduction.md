# Introduction

For centuries human beings have drawn maps to help them understand and navigate large or complex spaces. Indeed, it was the explorers who drew maps that tended to be the ones to actually get home again and be able share the tales of their adventures (and reap the profits!).

In the modern world and the modern work environment, the digital workplace is a large and complex place. We need a map to help us understand it and make sure it is providing the required value. So the documentation here is my attempt to map out the modern digital workplace.

I start by setting the scope for what I mean by the digital workplace and by defining its purpose.

Next, I cover the three "experiences" by which we decide what good looks like.

Then I descibe the seven core "jigsaw pieces" or "domains" that comprise the modern digital workplace.

If you take nothing else away after reading my map, then I hope you'll find 1-3-7 useful:
- One Purpose
- Three Experiences
- Seven Domains
