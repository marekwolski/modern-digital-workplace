The Purpose of the Digital Workplace is to connect users to the applications, data and other people they need to get their work done.

The User Experience is only one of three dimensions that a digital workplace needs to satisfy.

To be viable, a digital workplace needs to deliver across three “experience” viewpoints simultaneously:
- User Experience - those who have to use it
- Operational Experience - those who have to keep it working
- Business Experience - those who pay for it

### User Experience

From a user perspective, a good digital workplace can be determined by the extent to which it:
- Enables users to be productive
- Functions with low levels of operational friction
- Encourages users to be engaged with their work
- Supports users to become more comfortable and able with digital tools and digitised processes
- Empowers users to develop their digital workplace to meet new business challenges and deliver better outcomes

### Operational Experience

Keeping the digital workplace available, performant and current. Removing friction.

- knows how all the digital workplace systems and processes are performing (incl. availability and capacity)
- delivers on service requests
- fixes faults - able to quickly and safely identify and resolve; reactively and proactively
- carries out housekeeping
- minimises risks from updates and upgrades and new functions/features (there is safety and certainty for change)
- collects feedback; continual learning and improvement is expected (the way we do things)

### Business Experience

The perspective of those who pay for the digital workplace; those whose job it is to care that the business of the organisation is done (and not so much the how).

- the extent to which the digital workplace enables the business as a whole to deliver and succeed
	- is an enabler across all aspects of the organisation more than it is a constraint
	- and hence is seen as value for money
	- contributes to the "softer" aspects of running the business such as staff recruitment and retention and eNPS (employee net promoter score)
	- visible linkage between investment and business results
- can adapt and develop when the nature or the structure of the business needs it to
