> More than two-thirds [of companies] have adopted a new where and/or when of work, but only about a quarter of employees feel their employer has adequately supported them in changing how they work ...  nearly three-quarters of companies have not established team norms or meeting norms, they have not trained their managers in managing a distributed team, and they have not adopted best practices for how they work across distances.

- Hybrid Working - individuals working from different locations at different times and not always from a corporate office.
- Distributed Working - groups of people (possibly teams) working from different locations on the same project/task.
- Synchronous v Asynchronous Working - whether people do or don't need to be working together **at the same time** on a task (in a meeting).
