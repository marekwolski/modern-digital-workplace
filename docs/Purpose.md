The **PURPOSE** of the Digital Workplace is to connect users to the applications, data and other people they need to get their work done …

So a **GOOD** Digital Workplace can be determined by the extent to which it:

- Enables users to be productive
- Functions with low levels of operational friction
- Encourages users to be engaged with their work
- Supports users to become more comfortable and able with digital tools and digitised processes
- Empowers users to develop their digital workplace to meet new business challenges and deliver better outcomes

Therefore … the **GOALS** of the Digital Workplace team are to deliver a digital workplace experience that:

- Improves user productivity
- Reduces friction in the operational delivery and use of the digital workplace
- Increases users' engagement with their digital workplace
- Increases users' skills and abilities with a digital workplace
- Gives users a role in the development of the digital workplace to meet their own business needs and objectives

 So … the **STRATEGY** of the Digital Workplace team is to work on defined **OBJECTIVES** that deliver measureable **RESULTS** against those goals.

Every **OBJECTIVE** must contribute to meeting one or more of the **GOALS**. In choosing what to work on and what priority it should be given, the objectives should be assessed according to their contribution to the goals.
